## **1. Creating Files**
### **Create an Empty File (`touch`)**

**Command:**
```bash
touch filename
```

**Example:**
```bash
touch myfile.txt
```

---

## **2. File Permissions**
### **Understanding File Permissions in Linux**

File permissions in Linux determine who can **read**, **write**, and **execute** a file or directory. Permissions are assigned to three categories of users:

1. **Owner**: The user who owns the file.
2. **Group**: Users who belong to the file's group.
3. **Others**: All other users on the system.

---

### **Types of Permissions**
There are three basic types of permissions:

1. **Read (`r`)**: Allows viewing the contents of a file or listing the contents of a directory.
2. **Write (`w`)**: Allows modifying a file or adding/removing files in a directory.
3. **Execute (`x`)**: Allows running a file as a program or accessing a directory.

---

### **Permission Notation**
Permissions are represented in two ways:
1. **Symbolic Notation**: Uses letters (`r`, `w`, `x`) and symbols (`-` for no permission).
   Example: `rwxr-xr--`
2. **Numeric Notation**: Uses a 3-digit number (e.g., `755`), where each digit represents the permissions for the owner, group, and others.

---

### **How to Calculate Numeric Permissions**
Each permission type has a numeric value:
- **Read (`r`)**: 4
- **Write (`w`)**: 2
- **Execute (`x`)**: 1

To calculate the numeric permission:
1. Add the values of the permissions for each category (owner, group, others).
2. Combine the three numbers into a 3-digit code.

**Example:**
- `rwxr-xr--` translates to:
  - Owner: `rwx` = 4 + 2 + 1 = **7**
  - Group: `r-x` = 4 + 0 + 1 = **5**
  - Others: `r--` = 4 + 0 + 0 = **4**
- Numeric permission: **754**

---

### **Example Permissions**
| **Symbolic** | **Numeric** | **Explanation**                                                                 |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `rwxr-xr-x`  | 755         | Owner: full access; Group and Others: read and execute.                         |
| `rw-r--r--`  | 644         | Owner: read and write; Group and Others: read-only.                             |
| `rwxrwxrwx`  | 777         | Owner, Group, and Others: full access (not recommended for security reasons).   |
| `rw-------`  | 600         | Owner: read and write; Group and Others: no access.                             |

### **Viewing Permissions**
Use the `ls -l` command to view file permissions.

**Example:**
```bash
ls -l myfile.txt
```

**Output:**
```
-rw-r--r-- 1 user group 0 Oct 10 12:00 myfile.txt
```

- `-rw-r--r--`: Permissions (owner: `rw-`, group: `r--`, others: `r--`).
- `1`: Number of hard links.
- `user`: Owner of the file.
- `group`: Group associated with the file.
- `0`: File size.
- `Oct 10 12:00`: Last modified timestamp.
- `myfile.txt`: File name.

---

### **Changing Permissions**
Use the `chmod` command to change permissions.

**Example:**
```bash
chmod 755 myfile.txt
```

This sets the permissions to `rwxr-xr-x`.

---
