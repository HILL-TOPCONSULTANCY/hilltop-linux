#Managing users and groups is a crucial aspect of system administration. Shell scripts can automate user and group management tasks efficiently.
#Here's an example shell script to automate user and group management:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Function to create a user
create_user() {
    local username="$1"
    local password="$2"

    # Check if the user already exists
    if id "$username" &>/dev/null; then
        echo "User $username already exists."
    else
        # Create the user
        sudo useradd -m "$username"

        # Set the password
        echo "$username:$password" | sudo chpasswd

        echo "User $username created successfully."
    fi
}

# Function to delete a user
delete_user() {
    local username="$1"

    # Check if the user exists
    if id "$username" &>/dev/null; then
        # Delete the user
        sudo userdel -r "$username"

        echo "User $username deleted successfully."
    else
        echo "User $username does not exist."
    fi
}

# Function to create a group
create_group() {
    local groupname="$1"

    # Check if the group already exists
    if grep -q "^$groupname:" /etc/group; then
        echo "Group $groupname already exists."
    else
        # Create the group
        sudo groupadd "$groupname"

        echo "Group $groupname created successfully."
    fi
}

# Function to delete a group

    local groupname="$1"

    # Check if the group exists
    if grep -q "^$groupname:" /etc/group; then
        # Delete the group
        sudo groupdel "$groupname"

        echo "Group $groupname deleted successfully."
    else
        echo "Group $groupname does not exist."
    fi
